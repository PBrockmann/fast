FAST (Ferret Analysis Scripting Toolbox)

FAST is a library to facilitate post-processing and visualization with Ferret.

FAST is a collection of Ferret scripts and K-shell scripts. Its purpose is to hide a certain number of low-level and repetitive commands which can transform your Ferret scripts into long and unclear programs. With the scripts provided here, you will more easily control and set pages, viewports, texts, legends, colorbars, logos, ratios, zooms and also produce polygon maps and vectors maps.

Ferret is a very powerful application developed by the PMEL. I strongly recommend first reading the documentation and the tutorial they provide from their web site http://www.ferret.noaa.gov/Ferret/.
